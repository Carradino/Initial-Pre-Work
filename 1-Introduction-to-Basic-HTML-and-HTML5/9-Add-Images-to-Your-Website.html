<!-- Image tags <img> are self-closing tags used to add pictures to a webpage. They require a src attribute to locate the image. The alternate text attribute is not required but it is good practice to use one. In the event that the image fails to display, the text from the alt attribute will display instead so viewers have an idea of what picture should be there.  -->
