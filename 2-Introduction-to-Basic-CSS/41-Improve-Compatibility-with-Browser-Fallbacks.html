<!-- Older browsers that don't support newer CSS features might require additonal coding to ensure compatiblity. For example,
internet explorer doesn't support styles with CSS variables. To make the style more compatible it is a good idea to <section>
  the background color separately.
</section> -->
<style>
  :root {
    --red-color: red;
  }
  .red-box {
    background: red;
    background: var(--red-color);
    height: 200px;
    width:200px;
  }
</style>
<div class="red-box"></div>
